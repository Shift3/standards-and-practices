# Input Validation 

Input validation is your first line of defense when creating a secure application.  

## Whitelist or Blacklist? 

The first concept of good input validation is whitelisting versus blacklisting. Whitelist, or inclusive validation, defines a set of valid characters while blacklist, or exclusive validation, defines a set of invalid characters to try to remove. 

Input validation using blacklisting is generally more challenging to implement so it is better practice to perform validation using whitelisting. A great way of defining a whitelist for input validation is to leverage Regular Expressions(RegEx). 

## RegEx Password Validation Examples (JavaScript)

- Mininum length of any 8 chars but newline: 
```javascript
/^.{8,}$/
```

- Check for at least one uppercase character: 
```javascript
/([A-Z]+)/g
```

- Check for at least one lowercase character:
```javascript
/([a-z]+)/g
```

- Check for at least one numeric character: 
```javascript
/([0-9]+)/g
```

- Check for at least one special character:
```javascript
/([!"#$%&'()*+,\-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~])+/g
```

## RegEx Email Validation Example (JavaScript)

- DISCLAIMER: RegEx email validation should not be your sole source of email validation, rather it should be used to help your UI display an `invalid email` message. Whenever possible, one should include a process to confirm a given email address (e.g. send an email for the user confirm their email address).

- An email is a string (a subset of ASCII characters) separated into two parts by @ symbol, a "personal_info" and a domain, that is personal_info@domain. The length of the personal_info part may be up to 64 characters long and domain name may be up to 253 characters.

### Code Example:
```javascript
/^(?:\S+)@(?:\S+)(?:\.+\S{2,})$/
```

### The personal_info (before the @ symbol) and domain name (after the @ symbol but before the . symbol):

- Can contain any characters of any length except whitespace.

### The Top Level domain(TLD) (e.g com, org, net, in, us, info): 
- Can contain and end with any characters of any length except whitespace.
- Must be at least two characters long.

### Alternative Code Example: 
```javascript
  /.+@.+\..+/
```

- More permissive than previous example, essentially it allows \'anything\'@\'anything\'.\'anything\'.

### The above example more permissive than the previous example, esstentially it allows for <anythingo>

#### Fun fact: The longest TLD in English is .cancerresearch which is 14 characters. The longest currently in existence is 24 characters.

## Javascript methods to use with RegEx

- [String.prototype.match() - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match)

- [RegExp.prototype.test() - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match)
