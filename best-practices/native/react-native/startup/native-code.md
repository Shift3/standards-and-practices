# React Native Code Start up Guide

1. [Go here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) and make sure you have selected the `Building Projects with Native Code` tab. Follow the CLI installation instructions for your OS.
2. Take advantage of Bitwise's [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/react-native/) course on React Native. This will get you familiar with the basics of React Native's design patters, state management, and common best practices.
3. Install [Prop Types](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types) library to ensure type checking on your custom component props.
4. Take a look at our [common components](../common-components/README.md) for React Native and use what you need. Contribute some of your own reusable components if you have some!
