# Handle image in Nativescript-Angular

To handle image in Nativescript-Angular sometimes looks hard and frustrating to do so.

Doing some research I found this video from Alexander Ziskind:

[Use a Hook to Process Resource Images | NativeScript Tutorial by Alexander Ziskind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgK_d-1lG84&t=46s)

That video shows how `nativescript-images-generator-hook` plugin can make that task very easy.

[Images Generator Hook | NativeScript Marketplace ](https://market.nativescript.org/plugins/nativescript-images-generator-hook)

This plugin runs only in build moment. It is a build hook called to verify all images added in `App_resources\images` folder. Then its create copy from each image in small scale and save in to the respective folder,its depends which platform you are building the app (android/ios).

### How to setup:

1 - Install the plugin
`npm install nativescript-images-generator-hook --save-dev`

2 - Create a folder named `images` inside `App_Resources` folder.
3 - Add all of our images in the `images` folder.
    Remember that images should be in the highest resolution as the app will use.
4 - Rename the image file, adding this suffix `@?x`.
    `?` will be a number from 1 to 5.

Example: `imagename@3x.png`

P.S.: The image name **can not** have space or uppercase. That I find out when I compile.

Example.:

**Valid file name:**

```
  imagename.png (this will be treated as 1x)
  imagename@?x.png (?=1-5)
  image_name<suffix>.png
  image-name<suffix>.png
```

**Not Valid file name:**

```
  image name.png
  Image Name.png
  ImageName.png
  Image_Name.png
  Image-Name.png
```

Setup is done.


### How to use the image

Similar as `http://` protocol. In the code you can make reference to the image using `res://` (`res` means resource), with image name without suffix and extension. Like: `res://imagename`

Example:
On html page: `<Image src="res://imagename"></Image>`.
On css file: `background-image: url('res://imagename');`
On .ts files: `this.page.backgroundImage='res://imagename';`

That is it. All time consuming to generate all images we need for each particular screen size nightmare, is gone.
 
### Manual option

For any reason you decide to do all manually. Here a link to help with rescale and rename all the images: 

[Nativescript.Rocks ](https://images.nativescript.rocks/)

You upload an image, then the webpage returns a `zip` file with all multiple copy of the image you uploaded, inside its own folder (base on platform). Then you unzip that file and merge `App_Resources` folder, from zip file, `App_Resources` in your project.

Then you can use as [How to use the Image](#how-to-use-the-image) section explain.
