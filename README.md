#### Account Setup
  #### You will need to schedule time with Greg Goforth, Corey Schuman, Chris Hawkins, or Jody Hicks to gain access to the following:

  ##### AWS Account:
  *  AWS is our primary platform for deployment (staging and production) so you should familiarize yourself with their [JavaScript SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-node-js/) and [whitepapers](https://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/).

  ##### Shift3 Standards & Practices Meetings: 
  * Every two weeks the developers meet on Wednesday from 3:30pm - 4:00pm to discuss a new Standard or Practice for the company. These meetings are the place to voice your opinions on what we should be doing more of, less of, better at, etc. You are _highly_ encouraged to participate actively by leading a meeting on a topic of your choice. Ask Ryeker Herndon to add you to the GCal event so that you get reminders and emails.

  ##### Frontend Masters:
  * Shift3's main online teaching tool is Frontend Masters. They have courses on all of the platforms we employ at Shift3, and you should take advantage of as many as possible.

  ##### WebStorm:
  * If you prefer to use JetBrains' tooling, Shift3 provides us with WebStorm Suite for free. We also use Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.

  ##### Photoshop:
  * If your job entails design work, you will need to get access to the Shift3 Adobe Photoshop license.
