# Standards and Practices

## Reason for Repo

* We are trying to set minimal standards for Shift3/Bitwise projects.
* Have a central repository where other Shift3/Bitwise members can share knowledge of best practices. 
* Have a reference point to start a new project or answer questions on different topics.

## Code of Conduct
1. No cussing, we're beyond that
2. Keep the requests and issues professional and relevant to the work we're doing at Shift3/Bitwise
3. Treat others with the same respect you would if you were talking to them in person. Don't be a jerk.
4. Have fun and share your knowledge!

#### Account Setup
  #### You will need to schedule time with Greg Goforth, Corey Schuman, Chris Hawkins, or Jody Hicks to gain access the following programs:

  #### AWS Account:
  *  AWS is our primary platform for deployment (staging and production) so you should familiarize yourself with their [JavaScript SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-node-js/) and [whitepapers](https://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/).

  #### Shift3 Standards & Practices Meetings: 
  * Every two weeks the developers meet on Wednesday from 3:30pm - 4:00pm to discuss a new Standard or Practice for the company. These meetings are the place to voice your opinions on what we should be doing more of, less of, better at, etc. You are _highly_ encouraged to participate actively by leading a meeting on a topic of your choice. Ask Ryeker Herndon to add you to the GCal event so that you get reminders and emails.

  #### Frontend Masters:
  * Shift3's main online teaching tool is Frontend Masters. They have courses on all of the platforms we employ at Shift3, and you should take advantage of as many as possible.

  #### WebStorm:
  * If you prefer to use JetBrains' tooling, Shift3 provides us with WebStorm Suite for free. We also use Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.

  #### Photoshop:
  * If your job entails design work, you will need to get access to the Shift3 Adobe Photoshop license.

#### Contributing to Shift3
  #### You are expected to contribute _something_ to our processes. You can do this in many different ways, such as leading a S&P meeting, writing up a markdown sheet for this repository on a topic you are passionate about, leading a meetup, or posting discussion topics in Slack's Shift3 #random channel.
