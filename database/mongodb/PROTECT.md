# MongoDB

### Protect your MongoDB

1. Lock down access to your MongoDB instance's port 27017  
        _(reference: [guide](https://medium.com/@matteocontrini/how-to-setup-auth-in-mongodb-3-0-properly-86b60aeef7e8#.2tbt9or6y))_  
        * _27017 is MongoDB's default listening port and as such is most vulnerable to attacks._ 

     * In your ec2 instance command line, enter the following: 

        * _If you are using the same instance for both DB and API, you can skip this step as your MongoDB instance is already locked down_

        > sudo ufw allow from your_api_server_ip/32 to any port 27017
    
         to lock down that port to only listen to the ip address of your API instance. 
        
         * To make sure it worked, enter: 

            > sudo ufw status

2. Secure MongoDB's admin DB
        
    * Open your Mongo shell by running 

        > sudo mongo
    
    * Switch to the admin database 

        > use admin

    * Create an 'admin' user 
    
        * _(for consistency, please name the user admin, but change the password to a randomly generated 30-50 character string. **Make sure you keep that password string!**)_

        > db.createUser({ user: "admin", pwd: "adminpassword", roles: [{ role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" }] })

    * To check that it worked and to log yourself into the admin database in your MongoDB, enter

        > db.auth("admin", "adminpassword")

        _Please note: 
            1. Obviously you should change "adminpassword" to your actual password
            2. This command will be your log-in every time you first enter MongoDB_

    * Exit the MongoDB shell (run _exit_), and open your mongod.conf file with vim

        > sudo vim /etc/mongod.conf

    * In order to require authorization to access your database, scroll to the **security** section, and add the following: 

        > authorization: enabled

        * Save the file (**esc** > **:wq** > **enter**). It should look like this:  
            ![](../../../media/mongoconf.png)
    
    * Now you'll need to restart your MongoDB instance to have the changes take effect. Do so by: 

        > sudo systemctl restart mongodb

        * To check that it worked, run:

            > sudo systemctl status mongodb

            should return something similar to:  
                ![](../../../media/mongostatus.png)

3. Secure your project DB (if different from admin)
    _If you only have 1 database in MongoDB and it is the admin database, skip this step_

    * Log into MongoDB shell and switch to your admin db (run use admin)

    * Authenticate your user with 

        > db.auth("admin", "adminpassword")

    * Now switch to your database and create a user:   
        _Name your db something that makes sense (name of the client, project, etc.) and always use a different password from admin  
        We password protect the admin db **and** the individual db for extra security_

        > use yourdatabase  
          db.createUser({ user: "youruser", pwd: "yourpassword", roles: [{ role: "dbOwner", db: "yourdatabase" }] })

    * Authorize yourself with your new user, and try to list your collections to make sure it worked: 

        > db.auth("youruser", "yourpassword")  
          show collections

    * If your collections show up, your MongoDB is secure. If you want to double-check, exit the shell and log back in, then attempt to show collections in your db. 

4. Change your bindIp 

    * Exit the MongoDB shell and open your mongod.conf file again

        > sudo vim /etc/mongod.conf

    * Find the **net** designation, and change your bindIp from 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0

        *It should look like this:  
            ![](../../../media/netsettings.png)

5. Change your connection string

    * Wherever you have your connection string set up, change the string to this format: 

        > mongodb://youruser:yourpassword@mongodb-ec2-ip-address:27017/yourdatabase

    * ##A few notes:

        * Make sure your .env files, config.js files, and all password-holding files are _not_ checked in the git.

        * If you forgot to add these to the .gitignore file, you can have git stop tracking them by running 

            * **MAKE SURE** you have a copy of the file **BEFORE** you run this command!!!

            > git rm --cached -r name-of-file-you-want-to-stop-tracking

            * You'll need to change any passwords or config info that you had in the file because this will not delete these files from github's history.
