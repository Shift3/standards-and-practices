# Contributing to the Shift3 Standards & Practices Repository

### If you want to contribute, here's how:
1. Assign the issue for the change you want to make to yourself
  * If there is no issue, create one.
    * If you need to submit an issue, make sure the name is descriptive but brief and add a comment describing the change.
      > If you can't think of a way the change will benefit the team, consider looking over our [open issues](https://github.com/Shift3/standards-and-practices/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+First+Contribution%22) for something you can contribute that the team needs right now.
2. Clone the repository and create a new branch following the [Shift3 guideline](/git-and-github/branching.md)
3. Inside the appropriate folder, write out a clear, concise .md file on your topic of choice, or edit one that needs to be updated. Make sure you use the Markdown Cheatsheet linked below as a guideline.  
    ###### Add a link to your topic in your topic's parent folder's README<span>.md file. 
4. Push your code and create a PR, assigning at least two admins to review.
5. Respond to any feedback as quickly as you can. We want to fill this repo, so remember to take any reviews as constructive.
