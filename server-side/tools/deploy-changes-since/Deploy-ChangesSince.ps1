# Note that you should run this from the directory on your local machine where
# your source code is located. Also, make sure that you have the latest source
# (preferably from the master branch) checked out before you run this script!
# 
# Finally, make sure to give the correct path to Deploy-ChangesSince.ps1,
# either absolute or relative. Even if you're in the same directory as this
# file, PowerShell won't run it unless you specify ./ ahead of the filename.
