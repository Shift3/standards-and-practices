* [Deploy-ChangesSince.ps1](./deploy-changes-since/Deploy-ChangesSince.ps1) - This is a Microsoft PowerShell script that helps deploy your site's most recently modified files. (Don't worry, PowerShell runs on Linux and macOS now, not just Windows!) This script was written by yours truly (Stephen Tuggy). To start PowerShell, open a terminal window on your platform of choice, and run the command: `pwsh`. Beyond that, the comments at the top of the Deploy-ChangesSince.ps1 file itself should tell you what to do.
