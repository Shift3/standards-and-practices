# Optional Material

Here is where we will add all the optional standards that you can choose to abide by or not. Generally, we're putting these here because we think they're a good idea, but we understand not everyone is comfortable using the same linters, file structures, etc.

## Directory Structure

Check the included `EXAMPLE` directory and (directory-structure.md)[./directory-structure.md]

## StyleGuide

The included `EXAMPLE` directory uses the Airbnb style guide with eslint. See (styleguide.md)[./styleguide.md] and (the eslintrc settings)[./EXAMPLE/.eslintrc]
