### Branch Structure

```
Master
L- Staging
L- Development
   L- *Feature Branch*
   L- *Bug fix branch*
```

**Master** branch is for finalized, tested, and production-ready code.

**Staging** branch is for finalized, tested, and demo-ready code.

Working branch will be **development**. Pushes to development require Pull Request and review.

Sub-branches of development will be used to isolate tasks that are being worked on. These are for new features, fixes, or other tasks.

Create feature/fix/task branches to perform your work in. Include your initials so we keep track of who owns branches easily.
For example, if I'm (Corey) working on an bug fix task, I'll create a branch such as `cts-fix-uploader`.

When work is completed and tested, make a Pull Request to the development branch. This PR requires review from another developer before it is merged.

When code is ready to be locked in for demo, a Pull Request from `development` to `master` will be created and reviewed.

### Doing Development
- Always have an issue created for any work you are doing. It should contain:
  - Description of work to be done
  - Labels to categorize what type of task it is
- Make sure to include your new task on the project board in the correct column

### Bug Fixing
- If fixing a bug or issue reference the issue in the branch ex: `git checkout -b bugName_1`
- Also, include the issue number in the commit message to link to the issue ex: `git commit -m "type(scope):body. resolves #1"`

### Testing
**Will Update with @malarconjr5 workflow**
- When finished with the work on a task, move it into the "Testing" category
- Coordinate with someone from your team to have them test it
- When you are testing a task, make a comment on the tasks that says "I'm testing this."
- Add the "Testing" label to the task
  - If you run into bugs or issues, list them in your testing comment and notify the developer
- Go back and forth between tester and developer until all issues fixed


### Finishing a task
- If testing is complete, all issues fixed, move the task to "Done" and close the issue
