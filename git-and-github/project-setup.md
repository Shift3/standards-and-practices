# Project Setup

## Take your SOW (Statement of Work) and identify:
  1. Feature Sets
  2. Epics
  3. Issues

## Once you Have these,  
  1. Create a [project board](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/#creating-and-viewing-project-boards) tied to each Feature Set.

  2. Inside each project board, create a Column for each Epic

  3. Open as many issues as you need to complete each epic.  
    Remember: follow Shift3's [branching guide](branching.md) when you start working on these issues.

* This is your Project Manager's primary way of identifying your progress, so make sure you are updating these boards often with your progress.
