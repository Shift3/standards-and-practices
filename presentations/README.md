## Slide Decks

Our intrepid developers have compiled a wealth of knowledge about the technology we work with and the way we use it. The spreadsheet below is a compilation of slide decks and videos (if available) of Standards and Practices presentations given. These are a great resource if you're looking for tips and tricks, or if you need to prepare yourself for technology you haven't used before!

## Becoming a Presenter

Experienced with a tool or technology that you think will benefit our combined efforts? We'd love to hear you talk about it! Each presenter is granted an hour to present their topic; you'll also want to make a deck of slides to aid your presentation. The presentation does not need to fill a full hour, but we do have our presentation room reserved for that hour. Use the Google Doc below to sign up.

We've already grown so much from the lessons given at these sessions, and you can be a part of it! Happy presenting!
