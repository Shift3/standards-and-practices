## Project Board Setup

### Take your SOW (Statement of Work) and identify:
  1. Feature Sets
  2. Epics
  3. Issues

### Once you Have these:  
  1. Create a [project board](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/#creating-and-viewing-project-boards) tied to each Epic.  
    _In some projects, Epics will be exactly copied from Feature Sets, but this won't always be the case._
  2. Inside each project board, use Github's automation settings to make the project automated KANBAN style.  
  [Reference](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-automation-for-project-boards)
  3. Create an additional project board to track the others (one board to rule them all!) as follows:  
    * Create a note for each of your epics/project boards  
    * Make a markdown link in each note to the corresponding project board  
  3. Open as many issues as you need to complete each epic.  
    Remember: follow Bitwise's [branching guide](branching.md) when you start working on these issues.

* This is your Project Manager's primary way of identifying your progress, so make sure check the automated progress and tweak anything that needs to be changed as the project progresses.
