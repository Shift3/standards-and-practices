#### To add issue templates to your repository:

1. Go to your repository's `Settings` tab.
2. Under the `Options` section, scroll down to **Features**.
3. Make sure **Issues** option is selected (check the box) and click the `Set up templates` button.
4. Select which type of template you want to set up. Github has pre-configured templates that you can choose to use. You can edit the default templates if you need to, or you can add a custom template manually.
5. Once you are happy with the template, click on the green `Propose changes` button at the top right of the page.
6. Fill out the commit information that pops up. Choose the option to create a new branch and start a pull request rather than committing directly to your default branch.
7. Have your team review and approve your pull request. Once it is closed, you will have issue templates.
