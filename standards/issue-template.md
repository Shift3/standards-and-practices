## Issue Templates
#### Github has updated the process for adding issue templates to your repositories.

Follow the [step by step guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository).

#### To add issue templates to your repository:

1. Go to your repository's `Settings` tab.
2. Under the `Options` section, scroll down to **Features**.
3. Make sure **Issues** option is selected (check the box) and click the `Set up templates` button.
4. Select which type of template you want to set up. Github has pre-configured templates that you can choose to use. You can edit the default templates if you need to, or you can add a custom template manually. We have two issue templates in this repository for [Feature Request](https://github.com/Shift3/standards-and-practices/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) and [Bug Reports](https://github.com/Shift3/standards-and-practices/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) that are a good starting point.
5. Once you are happy with the template, click on the green `Propose changes` button at the top right of the page.
6. Fill out the commit information that pops up. Choose the option to create a new branch and start a pull request rather than committing directly to your default branch.
7. Have your team review and approve your pull request. Once it is closed, you will have issue templates.
